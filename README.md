# Seeds in Motion‚ú®üéÆ

Welcome to the "Seeds in Motion" project, a modern rendition of the classic Sokoban puzzle game, developed using Python and Pygame. This game blends traditional strategic gameplay with new interactive features, offering a seamless experience on Windows and Linux platforms. Players navigate through increasingly challenging levels, tracking their progress by time and moves, fostering continual improvement and competition.

## Game Overview‚≠ê

"Seeds in Motion" is a puzzle game where the player moves boxes to designated spots on a grid. Our version includes a single-player mode with time and move tracking for competitive play.

### Features

- Intuitive and engaging user interface.
- Single-player mode.
- Increasing difficulty levels.
- Time and move tracking for competitive play.
- Robust and educational gameplay experience.

## UML and Class Diagram‚≠ê

The UML and class diagrams illustrate the architecture of the game. The primary classes are `Player`, `Grid`, `BoxMovable`, and several levels.

### Class Descriptions

1. **Player**: Manages the player's position and movements.
2. **Grid**: Represents the game grid.
3. **BoxMovable**: Handles movable boxes within the game.

## Game Logic‚≠ê

### Main Components

1. **MainPage**: The main menu of the game.
2. **LevelsGrid**: Manages the game levels.
3. **LevelsSpecs**: Contains the specifications for each level.
4. **Player**: Controls player actions and movements.
5. **BoxMovable**: Handles the movable boxes.
6. **Grid**: Draws and updates the game grid.

### Detailed Explanation

### MainPage

The `mainPage.py` initializes the game, sets up the display, and manages the main menu interface. It includes buttons for starting single-player games and handles user interactions to navigate through the game options.

```python
import pygame
from levels_grid import offline_game

pygame.init()

width, height = 1060, 600
win = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
pygame.display.set_caption("Seeds in Motion / HEM ES")

# Load assets
background = pygame.image.load("assets/menu_interface.png")
offlineButton = pygame.image.load("assets/one_player_button.png")

offline_button = offlineButton.get_rect(center=(530, 407))

def main():
    pygame.mixer.init()
    main_music = pygame.mixer.Sound("assets/23_-_Road.ogg")
    main_music.play(-1).set_volume(0.5)
    run = True
    win.blit(background, (0, 0))
    while run:
        win.blit(offlineButton, offline_button)
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                run = False
            if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
                mouse_pos = event.pos
                if offline_button.collidepoint(mouse_pos):
                    pygame.mixer.quit()
                    offline_game()

```

### LevelsGrid

The `levels_grid.py` manages the different levels in the game, including loading levels, resetting them, and checking for victory conditions.

```python
import pygame
from Player import Player
from Grid import Grid
from BoxMovable import BoxMovable

pygame.init()

width, height = 1060, 600
win = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
pygame.display.setCaption("Sokoban GAME / HEM-ES")

background1 = pygame.image.load("assets/level_music.png")
background_congrats = pygame.image.load("assets/congrats.png")
background_mute = pygame.image.load("assets/level_mute.png")
victory_image = pygame.image.load("assets/just_back.png")
img = pygame.image.load("assets/seed.png")

class Levels:
    def __init__(self, grid, player, movables):
        self.grid = grid
        self.player = player
        self.movables = movables
        self.box_in_place = False
        self.img = pygame.image.load("assets/seed.png")
        self.win_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("assets/flowerput.wav")
        self.sound_played = False
        self.main_music = pygame.mixer.Sound("assets/Village.ogg")
        self.restart_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound("assets/restart.wav")
        self.initial_player_state = (player.grid_x, player.grid_y)
        self.initial_movables_states = [(m.grid_x, m.grid_y) for m in movables]

    def reset_level(self):
        self.player.grid_x, self.player.grid_y = self.initial_player_state
        self.player.update_pixel_position()
        for movable, (grid_x, grid_y) in zip(self.movables, self.initial_movables_states):
            movable.grid_x, grid_y = grid_x, grid_y
            movable.update_pixel_position()
        self.restart_sound.play().set_volume(0.8)

    def draw(self, win):
        win.blit(background1, (0, 0))
        self.grid.dessinerGrid(win)
        self.player.draw(win)
        for movable in self.movables:
            movable.draw(win)

    def check_victory(self):
        pygame.mixer.init()

```
